Once upon a time, there was a man who had given up on love. 
He had been hurt before and swore he would never let anyone into his heart again. 
But then he met a woman named Georgia. 
She wrapped him up in her love and he felt safe and content in her arms. 
He vowed to never let her go, even if he had done so before.

He used to say that he would never fall in love again, but Georgia changed his mind. 
He realized that falling in love with her was the only way he could fall. 
In the darkness of his past, she was the light that guided him out. 
She caught him when he fell, and he promised to catch her if she ever stumbled.
He was lost and broken, but Georgia found him and pieced him back together. 
And now he had found something he thought was lost forever: love. He had found it in Georgia.
