Can you remember
How Christmas makes you feel
That special magic in the air
And all your dreams were real
Can you remember
The smell of ginger bread
Candy canes and sugar plums
That dance inside your head
Remember when the twinkling stars at night
Told you reindeer were in flight
And jolly Santa Claus was on his way
The warmth of candle glow
A kiss of mistletoe
And magic lives and we believe
It's in our hearts to stay
Remember the caring
A season worth sharing
Believe in the magic in our lives
Just open up your heart
And relive the feeling
Just remember the magic
Yes, remember the magic
One more time
